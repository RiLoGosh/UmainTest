# 🍽️ Munchies

A web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

This project was a part of a technical interview with Umain, wherein a simple food delivery web application was to be made.

See the deployed version here:
https://umain-test.vercel.app/

## 🚀 Features

- A user sees a list of restaurants upon loading.
- A user can select or de-select filter options from either the sidebar or the overhead bar. Selecting a filter will change the list to only show those that fulfill the filters.
- These filters range from cuisine, price range and delivery time.
